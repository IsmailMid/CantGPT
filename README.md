AI's taking over the world; writing essays, composing musicâ€”even generating images and videos. But then, there's an AI that's designed to be the **worst chatbot ever**. CantGPT was supposed to be an alternative to ChatGPT, except it decided to give up halfway through existing.

This AI was **designed to be very lazy**. I wanted to build a chatbot _(just for fun)_, that did absolutely nothing. And somehow, it worked.

Because it is lazy, the chatbot has a **24-hour cooldown** for every message. It would think for about 3 seconds, then generate a lame response, making this the **most useless AI ever**.
